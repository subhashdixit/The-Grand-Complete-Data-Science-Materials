# Transcript Analysis 

## 1. Project Description
Present day social media platform has big pile of information growing exponentially each day and it is difficult to extract the desired information in the ocean of data especially from a transcript. 
Our project helps to extract the core essence of the transcript providing summary, topic classification, important keywords and hashtags. This project is made for offline purpose, requiring files to be downloaded from google drive. Incase of using it in online mode use the model name directly in transformers instead of downloaded files path. Model name used for each module is provided in documentation.

Please be patient during the deployment and the detailed documentation of APIs and DEPLOYMENT is provided in documentation folder. Code has been structured for ease of edit with logging and error handling incorporated for all modules along with client script to access RESTful APIs.

This project is my 4 months hardwork with sleepless nights and hurdles during my ML learning phase from scratch. Will be happy to accept suggestions and improvements for betterment. 

Incase of any issues in deployment feel free to contact me anytime
